In this homework, I tried to solve sleeping barber problem


First of all make sure that you are in same file with 
	makefile 
	barber.c
Then you need to make sure that you are running terminal codes in that folder.
Run make command in terminal then 
./barber <num_customer> <max_arrival_time> <max_haircut_duration> <haircut_repetition>
